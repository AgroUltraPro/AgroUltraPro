## The Problem
Agriculture has historically been and remains to this day one of the main pillars of the Indian economy as two-thirds of the Indian population is directly dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. At the crux of the agriculture sector lies the farmer, the Annadatta (Food Provider) of our country, who is facing many adversities today:

* With the diversity in soil types across the country farmers usually find it difficult to decide which crop is best suitable and profitable to their soil, their conditions, their region, and hence end up facing many losses. 
* Presently it is extremely difficult for farmers to predict the yield for a particular sowing season and the profit that they can earn due to unpredictable weather conditions.
* Dismally low profits that farmers earn for their produce because of the 'farm to market' mechanism which involves hundreds of middlemen who eat up most of the profits by transporting and selling crops

## Our Solution
An application for farmers to decide which crop to grow according to their soil conditions, region and area, for maximum quality, quantity and profitability. Along with this we also developed a web portal to connect farmers directly to the consumers, which enables farmers to keep their profits to themselves. 

A farmer can click a picture of soil, set his location and area parameters and feed these inputs to the web application. The output will be a list of crop recommendations based on predicted quality, quantity(yield), and gross revenue.
